    <string name="showcase_main_message">\n \n
        									\n Open Tenure is an open source software app, developed by UN-FAO, for the in-the-field recording of property rights.
											\n The boundaries of a land use can be mapped and property and land user details can be captured as well as images of
                                            \n supporting documents and photos of the land use.
											\n Open Tenure is used with a web based community server (such as SOLA Community Server) where existing land use details
                                            \n and map imagery can be downloaded before field capture and new details can be uploaded after field capture.
